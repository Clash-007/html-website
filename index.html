        <h1>Save Tigers</h1>

        <h2>Why should we save tigers?</h2>
        <p>At the turn of the 20th century, it is estimated that India probably had many thousands of tigers in the wild</p>
        <p>The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Government of India, have been conducting tiger estimation surveys in partnership with NGOs. WWF-India was the key NGO partner of NTCA, WII and state forest departments in conducting the comprehensive country-wide tiger estimation exercise in 2018, which revealed a mean tiger population estimate of 2,967 (range 2400-3050)</p>
        <p>Based on a census using the pug mark technique, the number of tigers in 2002 stood at 3,642.</p>

        <h2>If the tigers go extinct, the entire system would collapse.</h2>
        <p>For e.g. when the Dodos went extinct in Mauritius, one species of Acacia tree stopped regenerating completely. So, when a species goes extinct, it leaves behind a scar, which affects the entire ecosystem. Another reason why we need to save the tiger is that our forests are water catchment areas. </p>
        <p>Therefore, it’s not just about saving a beautiful animal. It is about making sure that our well being is maintained as the forests are known to provide ecological services like clean air, water, pollination, temperature regulation etc.</p>
